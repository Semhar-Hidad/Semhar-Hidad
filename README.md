### Hi there 👋 My name is Semhar!

### I am a **Technical Writer** with a background in Software Development & Information Technology. 

- 💻 I began my career in tech back in 2012 when I enlisted in the United States Marine Corps where I served as a Systems Administrator. Since then I have gained experience as a network engineer, cybersecurity specialist, and software developer.
- 👩‍🎓 I recently graduated from **Middle Tennessee State University** with a Bachelor of Arts in English.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on building my online portfolio and publishing my writing on sites like Medium, Dev, & LinkedIn. 
- 📖 I am an avid reader and I love learning new things! While I love self-development, I also really enjoy fiction novels. I just finished *Circe* by Madeline Miller and it was incredible. I just finished a few courses on Greek Literature in school so it was really cool reading through Circe's point of view! 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Leonardo DiCaprio didn't actually die in the *Titanic*. He was just acting 😂🤣
